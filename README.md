# HotalApp
-----------------------
This is a simple hotel management app project. The project contains/consists of two pages. 
1- The first page is to search for the available room types using start and end days. 
2- The second page is to enter the details of the guest, and book the selected room for them.

The main point of this project is to use the same simple business requirements to develop them in multiple asp.net applications/technologies.
The technologies are WPF, Web Application and Blasor add using Mudblasor.

Also, I will keep adding more features to this project with time.
